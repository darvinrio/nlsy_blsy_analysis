# Long term Optical Variability of high redshift (Z > 0.8) Narrow line Seyfert 1 Galaxies

## Abstract
We present long term optical flux variability studies of a sample of high redshift(z>0.8)
Narrow line Seyfert 1(NLSy1) galaxies form the catalogue of Rakshit et al. (2021) . From
a list of 2684 sources , a sample of 2468 had optical data in CRTS.The amplitude of variability for this sample was calculated. These were compared to a sample of 675 BLSy1
galaxies of similar apparent magnitude and redshift. Correlation between variability and
redshift was also carried out. It was found that the median variability of NLSy1 is greater
than that of BLSy1 galaxies. No correlation between redshift and variability is found.

## Plots

The variability distributions are similar to the eye, which then requires a K-S Test to check if the distribution are actually same or different.

we can see the peak of the NLSy1 AGNs have a more negative value than the BLSy1 counterparts , indicating a higher median value.

The plot shows the lack of significant correlation to the eye. Conducting correlation tests, output a weak correlation with 90 percent confidence.

## Results

* We compared a total of 2685 NLSy1 sources with 675 BLSy1 sources.
* The median of the two σm distributions are 1.305 and 1.274 for NLSy1 and BLSy1 respectively.
* Performing a 2 sample K-S test on the two distributions gave a D-statistic of 0.18 and a p-value of 2.66×10−15
* D-critical value for the test with alpha as 0.001 is 0.0532, indicating the two distributions are indeed different
* In the correlation test between amplitude of variability σm and redshift z , we get a Spearman’s rank coefficient of 0.0351 with a p-value 0.0859; a Kendall coefficient of 0.0233 with a p-value 0.0869, indicating a weak positive correlation with 90 percent confidence.

## Inferences

* NLSy1 galaxies are found to show larger amplitude of optical variations compared to BLSy1 galaxies
* No correlation between the amplitude of variability and redshift
