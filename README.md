## Abstract
We present long term optical flux variability studies of a sample of high redshift(z>0.8)
Narrow line Seyfert 1(NLSy1) galaxies form the catalogue of Rakshit et al. (2021) . From
a list of 2684 sources , a sample of 2468 had optical data in CRTS.The amplitude of variability for this sample was calculated. These were compared to a sample of 675 BLSy1
galaxies of similar apparent magnitude and redshift. Correlation between variability and
redshift was also carried out. It was found that the median variability of NLSy1 is greater
than that of BLSy1 galaxies. No correlation between redshift and variability is found.
